<h1 id="what-is-it-like-to-work-with-me">What is it like to work with me?</h1>

<p>Hi! It’s good to be working with you. I may be your manager, colleague or direct
report. Who knows what position I’ve gotten myself into by the time you are
reading this. I hope that, regardless of my position, this page can serve as a
brief summary of what working with me will be like.</p>

<h2 id="an-average-week">An average week</h2>

<p>I prefer a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes with reports and managers.
Occasionally there will be times when I won’t want to take up the full time but
I like to fill these with at least company updates or brainstorming ideas if we
don’t have anything pressing.</p>

<p>As far as my working schedule: I take a lot of coffee breaks, I work best when
highly caffeinated and also I notice that solutions to the tricky problems
always seem to happen when I’m in line for a coffee. It’s an expensive way to
problem solve. It may look like I start my mornings slowly. I find that the
most productive hours are the first couple hours after I wake up and I often use
those to practice a new skill, learn some new vim keybindings or really do
anything but check slack and email.</p>

<p>I may work into the evenings or weekends. That’s by choice and I don’t expect
anyone working with me to.</p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<p><strong>Customer first</strong>: I really enjoy working in truly customer first companies.
They are hard to find. I enjoy any activities or actions to shift a team to be
more customer first. Whether that’s tracking value in a different way or
changing teams to be more cross functional I try and push for these initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Time to think</strong>: I often respond to questions with “I don’t know” or buy
myself time to think about a problem. I like to come to meetings with a
document detailing what I think. I find that great decisions are made by
creative people given the time to think and digest problems. Not by rash
in the moment decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Consensus seeking</strong>: Within tech organizations, it’s imperative to have “buy
in” on new technology choices. Building for the long term requires that teams
understand why we are going with the technology that we are. I always will
strive to make sure that all voices are heard throughout the process.</p>
