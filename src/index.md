I currently work as a developer at Musefind where I wear many different hats in our organization. You can find me some days redesigning our user interface or sometimes building out our advanced influencer search tool.

I've spent the past four years pursuing a philosophy major with a minor in economics. Describing oneself as a philosophy major is usually a surefire way to get strange looks and alienate people. I always say that I chose philosophy because of pragmatic economic considerations. This usually provokes even further bewilderment. I believe however that the logical thought philosophy teaches is a skill applicable to all aspects of business. My economics minor, I hope, shows my lack of fear towards graphs, math, and further explorations of logic in our world. I'm an analytically driven creative type, always looking for a new way to do things but ultimately focus on data.

My work experience is varied. I've worked as a sailing instructor for the past seven summers, working my way up to a Head Instructor, a more management related role, for a sailing school that employs over 20 instructors in peak season. I've also been a Junior Analyst for the federal government, writing papers and analyzing trends in treaty negotiations with First Nations in BC. I also strongly believe in a good non-profit sector, and have worked as a Strategic Planning Coordinator with Burnaby Family Life, a medium sized non-profit in Burnaby.
