I am a self taught software developer, a sailor, an avid reader and a designer.

### Software Developer

I have worked as a software developer for over a year at Musefind. I've been in
charge of building out the core product as the lead backend developer as well as
architecting and building out core pieces of the frontend. I also manage all of
our resources on AWS.

### Philosophy Major

I've spent the past four years pursuing a philosophy major with a minor in economics. Describing oneself as a philosophy major is usually a surefire way to get strange looks and alienate people. I always say that I chose philosophy because of pragmatic economic considerations. This usually provokes even further bewilderment. I believe however that the logical thought philosophy teaches is a skill applicable to all aspects of business. My economics minor, I hope, shows my lack of fear towards graphs, math, and further explorations of logic in our world. I'm an analytically driven creative type, always looking for a new way to do things but ultimately focus on data.

### Sailing Instructor

My work experience is varied. I've worked as a sailing instructor for the past seven summers, working my way up to a Head Instructor, a more management related role, for a sailing school that employs over 20 instructors in peak season. I've also been a Junior Analyst for the federal government, writing papers and analyzing trends in treaty negotiations with First Nations in BC. I also strongly believe in a good non-profit sector, and have worked as a Strategic Planning Coordinator with Burnaby Family Life, a medium sized non-profit in Burnaby.
