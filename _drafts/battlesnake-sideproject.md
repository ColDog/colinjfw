title: "Battlesnake is a better side project"
description: |
  Why as a professional developer, I love building snake ai's to compete in a
  year round programming competition called Battlesnake.

Programming, more than any other discipline, requires practice to hone skills
and keep learning. One of the biggest challenges is finding that project that
you have the time to invest in, is fun and continues to challenge you long
term.

I find that I spend maybe more time trying to figure out which side project I
should look into next than actually working on things. Most developers have
stories similar to this. In this piece, I want to talk about the factors that
make me really excited about Battlesnake as a platform for learning and growing
as a developer.

Battlesnake is a fun programming competition where competitors build snake AI's
that battle against one another on a simple board. In the graphic below, all of
those snakes are programmed by someone like you. The model is simple: The core
server sends HTTP requests to your server and you respond with up, down, left
or right. That's it! I can make a simple snake that goes up (and then
dies within a few turns) in minutes.

## Complexity scales incredibly well

The programming competition hits a perfect sweet spot that's very hard to find
in this type of learning. Beginners who don't know what HTTP means can focus
on the basics. Figuring out how to get an HTTP server running is a great
starting tutorial for any beginner.

Ad the advanced levels the logic can get incredibly complex. One of the
unique challenges in gameplay is how a move relatively early on in the life of
a snake can doom it. Recognizing these situations is a great task for neural
networks. It's also something that can be programmed by hand by running
simulations into the future with the time afforded.

This is a unique challenge as beginner's can slowly implement some of this
logic as they

Imagine a google maps type of problem. It requires the ability to find the
fastest path to something but also imagine that there are trucks and cars that
can collide with you specifically on your path. It's a bit like a driverless
car but all of the features of the world are pulled out for you. Meaning it's
tractable from the point of view of a single developer working on it. You
don't need a team of experts to get something decent going.

## Learning real world skills

## All types of technology are possible

To get running with Battlesnake you don't need an SDK and you don't need to use
a specific language. Instead it's just an HTTP server and we don't run your
code for you.

I've enjoyed being able to learn new languages by trying to write the same
logic for my snake in a different language. I'm currently learning rust right
now by taking my python snake and re-writing it in rust. Because the logic is
complex and requires a good amount of abstractions

## It's free

Free to play and there are many different code hosting solutions for you to
use.
