  Why the hype around Kubernetes should disappear over the next few years
---

Kubernetes is an amazing platform. It's increasingly powering more and more
applications. The hype around it over the last few years has been incredible to
follow. The public slack has thousands of members and it's a widely known
technology.

My day job currently requires me to manage and understand some of the core
pieces of Kubernetes. It's a fantastic technology and it's helped me manage
some complex workloads with ease.

Overall though we should see some of the hype around Kubernetes start to drop.
With any hyped technology the hype drops eventually, but Kubernetes is a
special case. It isn't really meant to be this hyped up.
