## Colin Walker

I am a self taught software developer, a sailor and an avid reader. I currently work at Sendwithus as an development manager for our backend and infrastructure teams. As a developer I've worked to scale out a high throughput email delivery platform, maintain a Kubernetes based infrastructure and built many applications in Ruby on Rails.

I have been a sailing instructor for over 6 years and enjoy sailing whenever I can. I try and keep my passion for teaching throughout my work and enjoy working on productive and fun teams. I occasionally tutor at Lighthouse Labs.
