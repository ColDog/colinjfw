## Colin Walker

I am a full stack web and devops developer. I currently work at Sendwithus as a
developer for our backend and infrastructure teams. Iâ€™ve worked to scale out a
high throughput email delivery platform, built a Kubernetes cluster for an
enterprise product, managed Cassandra databases and built production Ruby on
Rails applications.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/colinjfw) is full of all my fun projects and is
a good representation of the types of programming that I enjoy working on.
I love to play with distributed systems, developer CI/CD tools, building
databases and sometimes hacking my own fitbit.

I have been a sailing instructor for over 6 years and enjoy sailing whenever I
can. I try and keep my passion for teaching throughout my work and enjoy
working on productive and fun teams. I occasionally tutor at Lighthouse Labs.
