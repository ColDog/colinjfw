## Colin Walker

Full stack generalist with significant experience building AWS infrastructure and Kubernetes clusters.

Iâ€™ve worked to scale out a high throughput email delivery platform, built a Kubernetes cluster for an enterprise product, managed Cassandra databases and built production Ruby on Rails applications.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/colinjfw) is full of all my fun projects and is
a good representation of the types of programming that I enjoy working on.
I love to play with distributed systems, developer CI/CD tools, building
databases and sometimes hacking my own fitbit.

I have been a sailing instructor for over 6 years and enjoy sailing whenever I
can. I try and keep my passion for teaching throughout my work and enjoy
working on productive and fun teams. I occasionally tutor at Lighthouse Labs.

I write on Medium at [https://medium.com/@colinjfw](https://medium.com/@colinjfw).

### Projects I'm working on

- [Deliverybot](https://deliverybot.dev): Simple GitHub deployment automation.
- [Battlesnake](https://battlesnake.com): Battlesnake is a fun engaging
  progrmamming game.
