I am a self taught software developer, a sailor and an avid reader.

I currently work at Sendwithus as a platform engineer where I work mainly in Go to scale out a high throughput email delivery platform.

I enjoy working on products end to end, from design to the backend implementation and deployment. I have production experience running Ruby, Rails and Python applications. I also love React and enjoy full stack projects.

In my personal projects I focus on developer tools, learning Golang and trying my hand at distributed systems.

I have been a sailing instructor for over 6 years and enjoy sailing whenever I can. I try and keep my passion for teaching throughout my work and enjoy working on productive and fun teams.
