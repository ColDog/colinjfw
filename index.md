## Colin Walker

I am a full stack web and devops developer. I currently work at Sendwithus as
a development manager for our backend and infrastructure teams. I've worked to
scale out a high throughput email delivery platform, build a Kubernetes cluster
for an enterprise product, managed Cassandra databases and built some complex
Ruby on Rails applications from scratch.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/ColDog/) is full of failed projects and random
ideas but in my personal time I love to play with distributed systems, building
databases and sometimes hacking my own fitbit.

I have been a sailing instructor for over 6 years and enjoy sailing whenever I
can. I try and keep my passion for teaching throughout my work and enjoy
working on productive and fun teams. I occasionally tutor at Lighthouse Labs.
